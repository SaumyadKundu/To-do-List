# To-Do-List

## Introduction
This project is a note-taking webiste with authentication system functionality built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register, sign in, add notes, and sign out. The application provides a secure login mechanism and ensures that each user's notes are stored separately. It is designed to be entirely client-side, meaning the account creation process occurs locally in the user's browser.
