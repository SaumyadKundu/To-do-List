# To-Do-List

## Introduction
This project is an authentication system with note-taking functionality built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register, sign in, add notes, and sign out. The application provides a secure login mechanism and ensures that each user's notes are stored separately. It is designed to be entirely client-side, meaning the account creation process occurs locally in the user's browser.

## Features
- User registration: Users can create an account by providing a username and password.
- User authentication: Users can sign in with their credentials to access their notes.
- Note-taking: Authenticated users can add, view, and delete notes.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work on various devices and screen sizes.

## Usage
- Registration: Users can register for an account by providing a username and password.
- Authentication: Once registered, users can sign in using their credentials.
- Note-taking: Authenticated users can add notes using the input field and delete them using the delete button beside each note.
- Sign out: Users can sign out to securely log out of their accounts.
